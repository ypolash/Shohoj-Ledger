# MISSION

**Core Goal:**
Develop a Company Finance & Revenue Sharing CRM (Shohoj Ledger) to manage income, expenses, reserve balances, member loans, due balances, and monthly settlements. The system ensures that only paid/partial income is included in settlement, and shares are calculated properly between the CEO (40%), Developers (20%), Advisor (20%), and Company reserve (20%).

**Current Status:**

- **Last major feature added:** Upgraded the Settlement Management module to match the unified Enterprise SaaS UI system. Removed the static form, implemented a full-width dashboard with six metric cards (Total Settlements, Completed/Pending Settlements, Total Amount, etc.), and integrated advanced filters, modals, and a detailed drawer view. The frontend architecture is now standardized across Income, Expenses, Projects, Funds, Reserves, Loans, Advances, and Settlements.
- **Next Phase:** Align the final remaining module (Leads) to this unified UI standard, and verify End-to-End Task Management and Attendance integration in the Android App.

**Goal Pivots:**

- Transitioned away from Better Auth towards a custom `jose` and `bcryptjs` JWT implementation (with backward compatibility) to support distinct Admin (User) and Employee login flows properly.
- Temporarily relaxed strict GPS constraints (radius increased to 200km) and missing Wi-Fi checks to facilitate remote development and testing off-site.
